    <b>An example implementing a preview pane.</b>
      Obviously the most visual demo, the preview pane is accomplished
      entirely outside of Jcrop with a simple jQuery-flavored callback.
      This type of interface could be useful for creating a thumbnail
      or avatar. The onChange event handler is used to update the
      view in the preview pane.
